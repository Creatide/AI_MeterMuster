======================================

![MeterMuster Logo](https://github.com/Creatide/AI_MeterMuster/blob/master/README/MeterMuster_Logo.png)

With MeterMuster you can create circular scales, digital cluster scales, ticks to clocks, sci-fi elements, motion graphics assets and so onâ€¦ Just paly with values and get nice circular scales to your artwork.

## Install

This is a script. There's no installation needed for using it. 

You can use script by dropping script file over Illustrator.

Or select `"File" > "Scripts" > "Other Scripts..."` and select script file.

## How to Use

Just start script and there will be opened dialog panel with default settings. Change these values to explore results and you got the point how MeterMuster works.

MeterMuster creates always new document when you running the script. Even if you close it! :)

#### Features

| --- | --- |
| **Meter Size** | Size of the circular scale in pixels. |
| **Segments Number** | How many segments / lines there will be in your scale. |
| **Line 1 and 2** | There is options for two lines. So you can use two different lines in scales, that's it. |
| **Line Width** | Line width in pixels. |
| **Line Height** | Line height in pixels. |
| **Second Line** Interval | Use second line based to this value e.g. 2 means you use second line every other line in scale. |

## About
I've developed this script to make it easier to build scales for digital clusters, clocks, sci-fi assets and so on... It's still quite experimental stage and there could be much more to make it even better. Best would be if it works inside of CC panel and you can customize values on the fly... Maybe someday I'll update it. I have quite nice time with this script while I've tried random values there, maybe you'll find it useful too or use it base for your own version of it.

Where the name MeterMuster came? I don't even remember. Maybe MeterMustache would be better!
